    # By default, sharder keeps everything in RAM for faster reprocessing, but if you chain segment
    # is heavy, this can starts to cost a lot of RAM. By using a scratch directory, you instruct the
    # sharder to accumulate on disk its partial state instead of in RAM. This is a trade-off betwen
    # being more I/O bound over RAM bound.

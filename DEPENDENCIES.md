# Dependencies

dfuse for EOSIO requires our instrumented `nodeos` binary, a fork
of the standard `EOSIO` software.

You will also want to build both the `dashboard` and the `eosq` apps

## Building web apps

* **NOTE: Building web apps is done as part of the ./build.sh script**

Building `eosq`:

```
cd eosq
yarn install
yarn build
```

and building the `dashboard` from dlauncher, copying the ricebox to this repo:

```
pushd ..
  git clone git@github.com/streamingfast/dlauncher
  pushd dashboard
    pushd client
      yarn install
      yarn build
	popd
    go generate
  popd
popd
go generate ./dashboard # copies the ../dlauncher/dashboard/rice-box.go file to ./dashboard
```

## dfuse Instrumented EOSIO Prebuilt Binaries

dfuse uses a specialized EOSIO binary that contains instrumentation required
to extract the data needed to power all dfuse's features.

The current source code can be found on branch [release/2.0.x-dm](https://github.com/dfuse-io/eos/tree/release/2.0.x-dm)
under [github.com/dfuse-io/eos](https://github.com/dfuse-io/eos) fork of EOSIO software.

**Notes**:

* It is safe to use this forked version as a replacement for your current installation, all
  special instrumentations are gated around a config option (i.e. `deep-mind = true`) that is off by
  default.

* This instrumentation has been merged in the upstream develop branch,
  but is not yet in a release: https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/8788

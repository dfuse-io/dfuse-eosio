## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.0] 2020-04-03

### Added
* Added `--nodeos-path` to control which `nodeos` executable is used.

### Removed
* Removed `--chain-name`, replaced by `--config-file` (or `-c`)
* Removed `init --reset` option, `dfusebox purge` does it all now.

### Changed
* `--data-dir` now defaults to `./dfusebox-data`, and is separate from a chain name or the config file location.
* `dfusebox init` now only generates a `dfusebox.yaml` config file, which can be booted with `dfusebox start`.
* `dfusebox init` now only has the interactive method. We can later add more programmatic method to boot chains.  With a `dfusebox.yaml` config now, however, we can reuse initializations multiple times.
* License changed to Apache 2.0
* Added GitHub workflow for PR checks
